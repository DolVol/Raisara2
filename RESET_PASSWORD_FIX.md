# Password Reset Fix Summary

## Problem
The reset password functionality on your Render server was failing with the error "Token and password are required" even when both fields were provided.

## Root Cause
There was a **field name mismatch** between the frontend and backend:

- **Frontend (reset_password.html)**: Sends `new_password` field
- **Backend (app.py)**: Was looking for `password` field

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Field Name Mismatch
**File**: `app.py` (line ~11769)

**Before**:
```python
new_password = data.get('password')
```

**After**:
```python
new_password = data.get('new_password') or data.get('password')
```

This change makes the backend accept both `new_password` (from the frontend) and `password` (as fallback).

### 2. Fixed Syntax Errors
**File**: `app.py`

Fixed several syntax issues in the `reset_password` function:
- Missing commas in `jsonify()` calls
- Incorrect indentation
- Route decorator syntax

### 3. Corrected Template References
**File**: `app.py`

Fixed the GET request handling to use the correct template:
- Changed from `auth/reset_request.html` to `auth/reset_password.html`

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests that verify:
- âœ… Valid data with `new_password` field
- âœ… Valid data with `password` field (fallback)
- âœ… Missing token validation
- âœ… Missing password validation
- âœ… Password mismatch validation
- âœ… Password length validation

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy to Render
1. Commit and push your changes to your Git repository
2. Render will automatically deploy the updated code
3. Wait for the deployment to complete

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Go to your Render app URL
2. Navigate to the forgot password page
3. Request a password reset
4. Use the reset link to set a new password
5. Verify that the "Token and password are required" error no longer appears

### 3. Verification Steps
1. **Request Reset**: Go to `/forgot_password` and enter your email
2. **Check Logs**: Look for the reset URL in your Render logs (if email fails)
3. **Reset Password**: Use the reset link with a new password
4. **Login**: Verify you can login with the new password

## Technical Details

### Frontend Data Structure
The reset password form sends:
```javascript
{
    "token": "user_reset_token",
    "new_password": "user_new_password",
    "confirm_password": "user_confirm_password"
}
```

### Backend Processing
The backend now handles:
```python
token = data.get('token')
new_password = data.get('new_password') or data.get('password')  # âœ… Fixed
confirm_password = data.get('confirm_password')
```

### Validation Flow
1. Check if token and password are provided
2. Verify passwords match
3. Ensure password is at least 6 characters
4. Validate reset token
5. Update user password
6. Clear reset token

## Files Modified
- `app.py` - Fixed reset_password function
- `test_reset_simple.py` - Created for testing (optional)
- `RESET_PASSWORD_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FIXED** - The reset password functionality should now work correctly on your Render server.

The error "Token and password are required" will no longer appear when valid data is submitted.
