# Extra Cutting Trees Fix

## Problem Identified
When copying a mother tree with 12 cutting trees:
- **Expected**: 20 trees total (original) ‚Üí 20 trees total (after paste)
- **Actual**: 20 trees total (original) ‚Üí 24 trees total (4 extra cutting trees added to empty grid)

## Root Cause
The auto-inclusion feature was adding ALL cutting trees belonging to the mother from anywhere in the dome, not just the ones that should be copied.

### What was happening:
1. **Drag area contains**: 1 mother tree + 12 cutting trees = 13 trees
2. **Auto-inclusion finds**: ALL cutting trees for that mother in the entire dome (16 total)
3. **Auto-inclusion adds**: 4 additional cutting trees from outside the drag area
4. **Result**: 13 + 4 = 17 trees copied instead of 13
5. **After paste**: 20 + 4 = 24 trees total

## Solution Applied
Disabled the auto-inclusion feature to prevent extra cutting trees from being added.

### Code Changes in app.py:

```python
# Before (causing extra trees):
area_trees.extend(additional_trees)
print(f"üì¶ Total trees after auto-inclusion: {len(area_trees)} (added {len(additional_trees)} cuttings)")

# After (preventing extra trees):
# ‚úÖ DISABLED: Auto-inclusion to prevent extra cutting trees being added
# Only copy trees that are explicitly in the drag area
# area_trees.extend(additional_trees)
print(f"üì¶ Copying only trees explicitly in drag area: {len(area_trees)} trees")
print(f"‚ÑπÔ∏è Skipped auto-inclusion of {len(additional_trees)} cutting trees to prevent duplication")
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
When copying a mother tree with 12 cutting trees:

1. **Copy**: Only trees explicitly in the drag area are copied (13 trees: 1 mother + 12 cuttings)
2. **Paste**: 13 new trees are created at the new location
3. **Transfer**: Original cutting trees are handled by the transfer logic
4. **Result**: 20 trees total (no extra trees added)

### Detailed Flow:
- **Original grid**: 20 trees (1 mother + 12 cuttings + 7 other trees)
- **Copy operation**: Copies 13 trees from drag area (1 mother + 12 cuttings)
- **Paste operation**: Creates 13 new trees (1 new mother + 12 new cuttings)
- **Transfer logic**: Removes 12 original cuttings from old mother
- **Final result**: 20 trees total (1 new mother + 12 new cuttings + 1 old mother + 7 other trees)

## Benefits
1. **Prevents duplication**: No extra cutting trees are added
2. **Predictable behavior**: Only trees in the drag area are copied
3. **Maintains relationships**: Transfer logic still handles mother-cutting relationships
4. **Preserves grid count**: Total tree count remains consistent

## Status
‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Auto-inclusion disabled to prevent extra cutting trees from being added to the grid.

## Testing Instructions
1. Create a drag area with a mother tree and some (but not all) of its cutting trees
2. Copy the drag area
3. Paste the drag area
4. Verify that only the trees that were in the original drag area are copied
5. Verify that no extra cutting trees are added to empty grid positions
